PS: This is the first website I've ever created as part of my front-end web development assignment. So, if you find any bugs… uh, let’s call them "features"! This project marks the beginning of my journey into the chaotic yet exciting world of web development. It may not be the next Facebook or Google (yet), but hey, even they had to start somewhere, right?


Note: The project may not work as expected as the APIs and keys have been terminated.
